#  WEATHER-5K Benchmark 
WEATHER-5K dataset consists of a comprehensive collection of data from 5,672 weather stations worldwide, spanning a 10-year period with one-hour intervals. It includes multiple crucial weather elements (temperature, dewpint temperature, wind speed, wind rate, sea level pressure), providing a more reliable and interpretable resource for forecasting.

<!-- 
**Note: We will keep updating this leaderboard.** If you have proposed advanced and awesome models, you can send us your paper/code link or raise a pull request. We will add them to this repo and update the leaderboard as soon as possible. -->

**Compared models of this leaderboard.** â˜‘ means that their codes have already been included in this repo.


## Usage

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the well pre-processed datasets from [[OneDrive]](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/thanad_connect_ust_hk/EhYDpJPhvixNkfJXXZkKOxcBxTa7ckEE70c65x8PKsYRKQ?e=kSvrrf), Then place and `unzip` the downloaded data in the folder`./dataset`. 


3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts for all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
# Global Station Weather Forecasting
bash ./scripts/weather-5k/iTransformer.sh

```

4. Develop your own model.

- Add the model file to the folder `./models`. You can follow the `./models/Transformer.py`.
- Include the newly added model in the `Exp_Basic.model_dict` of  `./exp/exp_basic.py`.
- Create the corresponding scripts under the folder `./scripts`.
